Albert's Public-side CS107E stuff

Besides the fact that the CS107E repository has not been made public, I can't
share code from the class outside of the class.  However, I can share cursory
descriptions and personal documentation that does not contain code or materials
directly related to the courseware.  I won't post much, but this way anyone who
is interested can see some of the cool things my classmates and I were able to
build in this awesome class.
