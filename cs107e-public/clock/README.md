##Clock UI Extension

Just for kicks, I decided to spend a bit of extra time on a CS107E assignment,
which implemented a digital clock on a Raspberry Pi.  There was an extension:
create a UI for changing the time displayed on the clock using no more than 2
pushbuttons.

I was happy with the result.  It was simple and intuitive, tangible and useful.
The code was clean (or at least not messy), the documentation was good, and I
managed to get the whole thing running perfectly in the span of an hour or so.
I love large, extensive projects that require a deep investment of time,
energy, and thought, but for me, the speediness of the process and the
satisfying product made this little side project my personal standard of a
well-done hack, and thus one of my favorites.
